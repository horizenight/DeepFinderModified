Introduction
============

DeepFinder is an original deep learning approach to localize macromolecules in cryo electron tomography images.
The method is based on image segmentation using a 3D convolutional neural network.

Context
-------
This method has been developed in the frame of **Emmanuel Moebel**'s PhD thesis at Inria Rennes, under **Charles Kervrann**'s
supervision (team Serpico).

If you are curious, you can access his PhD manuscript `here <https://hal.inria.fr/tel-02153877>`_ , entitled
"New strategies for the identification and enumeration of macromolecules in 3D images of cryo electron tomography".

What DeepFinder is
------------------
DeepFinder is a python3 package that allows analysing **3D images** with a **deep learning** method. It possesses a **graphical
user interface** to allow non-computer scientists to work with this tool. It is based on the Keras package.
